Inquired about git branching strategy
To safely experiment with Firebase while preserving your localStorage implementation:

Create a new branch for Firebase work:


git checkout -b firebase-datastore
This creates and switches to a new branch called firebase-datastore. All your changes will now be isolated here.

To switch back to your main version (with localStorage):


git checkout main
To switch back to Firebase branch:


git checkout firebase-datastore
When you're done with Firebase development:

If it works and you want to keep it:
git checkout main
git merge firebase-datastore


If you want to abandon it and delete the branch:


git checkout maingit branch -D firebase-datastore
View all branches:


git branch
(The asterisk shows your current branch)

Commit regularly on the Firebase branch:


git add .git commit -m "Add Firebase authentication"

git push -u origin firebase-datastore
This way your localStorage version stays intact on main, and you can freely experiment with Firebase on the separate branch without any risk.

No, only for the first push. The -u flag sets the upstream tracking, so after you run:

Once, you can then just use:

For all subsequent use
 git push
